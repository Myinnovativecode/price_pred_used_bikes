# 🏍️ Used Bikes Resale Value Prediction

This project uses a neural network model to predict the resale value of used bikes based on various features such as bike brand, owner type, manufacturing year, and more. It includes complete data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and a user-friendly Streamlit web app.
